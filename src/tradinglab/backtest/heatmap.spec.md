# backtest/heatmap.py — Spec

## Purpose
Pure metric + geometry layer for the sandbox heatmap. Turns candles,
per-symbol classification, and a replay-clock timestamp into a
laid-out, colored `HeatmapModel` — a Finviz-style sector → industry
treemap sized by historically-scaled market cap and colored by 1-Day
percent change. Contains no Tk and no matplotlib so every rule is
headless-testable. The window in
[`gui/sandbox_heatmap.py`](../gui/sandbox_heatmap.spec.md) renders the
model it returns. See [`docs/SANDBOX_HEATMAP.md`](../../../docs/SANDBOX_HEATMAP.md).

## Public API
- `@dataclass(frozen=True) class Classification` — `sector: str`,
  `industry: str`. Per-symbol **static** metadata, injected. Share
  counts are time-varying (buybacks / dilution) and are **not** stored
  here — they come from a historical-shares provider and reach this
  layer already snapped, via `size_by_symbol`.
- `@dataclass(frozen=True) class HeatmapTile` — `symbol`, `sector`,
  `industry`, `size: float`, `approx_size: bool` (True when `size` used
  a carried-back share count), `x/y/w/h: float` (normalized `[0,1]`
  geometry), and post-color `pct: float | None` + `fill: str` (hex).
- `@dataclass(frozen=True) class HeatmapLayout` — `tiles: tuple[HeatmapTile, ...]`
  (geometry only, no color), `sector_bounds` / `industry_bounds`
  (group rectangles for headers + borders), `size_basis: str`.
- `@dataclass(frozen=True) class HeatmapModel` — a colored layout:
  `tiles`, `as_of_ts: int`, `timeframe: str`, `clip_pct: float`,
  `universe_id: str`.
- `members_asof(date_added_by_symbol, as_of_ts) -> tuple[str, ...]` —
  point-in-time membership filter: the current members whose `Date added`
  ≤ `as_of_ts`. Removes look-ahead names; the caller feeds the result to
  `build_layout(symbols=…)`.
- `build_layout(*, symbols, size_by_symbol, classification, approx_size_symbols=frozenset()) -> HeatmapLayout`
  — group sector → industry, run `squarify`, return geometry; tiles
  whose symbol is in `approx_size_symbols` get `approx_size=True`.
  Called at session roll only.
- `apply_colors(layout, *, pct_by_symbol, as_of_ts, clip_pct=3.0, timeframe="1D", universe_id="") -> HeatmapModel`
  — attach `pct` + Finviz `fill` per tile; stamp `as_of_ts` / `timeframe`
  / `universe_id` onto the model. Called every bar.
- `compute_1d_pct(price_at_clock, prior_close) -> float | None` —
  `(price − prior_close) / prior_close × 100`; `None` on missing input.
- `scaled_cap(shares, price) -> float` — `shares × price`. Caller must
  pass **raw** (as-reported) shares with **raw** (unadjusted) price so
  splits self-cancel (see Invariant 7).
- `price_at_or_before(candles, as_of_ts) -> float | None` — close of the
  last candle at/before `as_of_ts` (no-future-leakage lookup; ms→s
  normalized; ascending candles; NaN-close bars skipped). The caller's
  building block for `size_by_symbol` / `pct_by_symbol`.
- `squarify(values, x, y, w, h) -> list[tuple[float, float, float, float]]`
  — vendored squarified-treemap rectangle packer.
- `finviz_hex(pct, clip_pct=3.0) -> str` — % → bucketed red/green hex.
- `relative_luminance(hex) -> float` / `text_color_for(fill_hex) -> str`
  — luminance-based label-color chooser.

## Dependencies
- Internal: [`models`](../models.spec.md) (`Candle`), [`core/timezones`](../core/timezones.spec.md) (`normalize_epoch_to_seconds`).
- External: `dataclasses`, `math`, `collections` (stdlib only). No numpy, Tk, or matplotlib — the layout math is pure Python.

## Design Decisions
- **Two-phase build mirrors the update cadence.** `build_layout`
  (geometry, expensive squarify) is separated from `apply_colors`
  (per-tile fill, cheap) so the window can relayout per session and
  recolor per bar (decision 8) without re-running squarify each tick.
- **Geometry/color core never reads the clock; one clock-aware helper.**
  `build_layout` / `apply_colors` consume caller-supplied
  `size_by_symbol` / `pct_by_symbol`, so the geometry is a pure function
  of its inputs. The single clock-aware utility is
  `price_at_or_before(candles, as_of_ts)` — a pure, testable lookup that
  enforces the no-future-leakage boundary at the price-fetch site (never
  returns a close after the clock; normalizes ms→s by magnitude via the
  shared `core.timezones.normalize_epoch_to_seconds`, so the `1e12` ms/s
  threshold lives in exactly one place). The
  caller composes it into `size_by_symbol` / `pct_by_symbol`.
- **Historically-scaled cap, not current cap** (decision 3). `size` is
  `scaled_cap(shares_at_session, session_reference_price)` so tile area
  reflects the historical moment. `shares_at_session` is the caller's
  historical share count (yfinance `get_shares_full`, most-recent value
  ≤ the session), capturing buybacks / dilution — not a constant.
  **Before the series starts** the caller carries back the earliest
  known count (nearest-in-time, never today's) and flags the symbol so
  its tile is `approx_size`. Price and shares must share a split basis
  (Invariant 7).
- **1-Day % is the only color metric in v1** (decisions 4, 5). The
  color basis is a single injected `pct_by_symbol` map; a future RS /
  vs-SPY or custom-RS basis is a drop-in different map, so no signature
  change is needed to add it.
- **Finviz-exact fixed palette** (decision 11). `finviz_hex` buckets %
  into the Finviz red ↔ neutral ↔ green steps clipped at `±clip_pct`
  (default 3.0); the scale is fixed, never auto-ranged, so bar-to-bar
  color change is meaningful.
- **Vendored squarify, no dependency** (decision 6). The ~40-line
  algorithm is deterministic and unit-testable; adding a PyPI treemap
  package for it is not worth the release-surface cost.
- **Unknown classification is grouped, not dropped.** A symbol whose
  `Classification` is missing or empty lands in an `Unclassified`
  sector so the map stays complete.
- **Point-in-time membership via `Date added`** (v1 survivorship
  stance). `members_asof` drops current members added after the replay
  clock, so look-ahead names never appear; composition changes as the
  clock crosses an add date (the caller handles it like a session roll).
  Removed / delisted names are a documented residual — recovering them
  needs a changes-log (v2). The caller resolves members by CIK / name,
  not bare ticker, to avoid recycled-ticker mismatches.

## Invariants
1. `squarify` output rectangles tile the parent exactly — Σ areas ==
   `w × h` within float epsilon — with no negative or zero dimensions
   for positive input values.
2. `squarify` is deterministic: identical input order → identical
   geometry.
3. Every input `symbol` appears in exactly one `HeatmapTile`; grouping
   is strictly sector → industry; missing metadata → `Unclassified`.
4. `apply_colors` never mutates `layout`; it returns a new
   `HeatmapModel`.
5. Color is symmetric about 0 and clipped to `[−clip_pct, +clip_pct]`;
   `pct is None` (missing data) maps to the neutral fill, never a
   red/green extreme.
6. No value is read from any candle beyond `as_of_ts` — enforced by the
   caller supplying only clock-bounded prices (documented contract).
7. **Split-consistency:** tile `size` multiplies price and shares on the
   same split basis (raw price × raw shares, so a split is a wash);
   split-adjusted price is never multiplied by raw as-reported shares.
8. **No look-ahead membership:** no symbol with `Date added` >
   `as_of_ts` appears in a layout built from `members_asof` output;
   the boundary (`Date added == as_of_ts`) is included.
9. `approx_size` is True exactly for tiles whose symbol was in
   `approx_size_symbols` (carried-back share count); it affects neither
   geometry nor color.

## Data Flow / Algorithm
```text
# per session roll:
sizes   = {sym: scaled_cap(raw_shares_at(sym, session), raw_price[sym]) ...}  # split-consistent
layout  = build_layout(symbols, sizes, classification)
  ├─ group symbols by sector, then industry (Unclassified fallback)
  ├─ squarify sectors within [0,1]², by summed child size
  ├─ squarify industries within each sector rect
  └─ squarify symbols within each industry rect  → tile x/y/w/h

# per bar:
pcts  = {sym: compute_1d_pct(price_at_clock[sym], prior_close[sym]) ...}
model = apply_colors(layout, pct_by_symbol=pcts, as_of_ts=clock)
  └─ tile.fill = finviz_hex(pct, clip_pct); tile.pct = pct
```

## Testing
- `tests/unit/backtest/test_heatmap.py` — squarify tiling /
  determinism / no-negative-dims; `compute_1d_pct` `None` on missing /
  zero prior close; `price_at_or_before` no-future-leakage cutoff +
  ms/s normalization + NaN-close skip; `scaled_cap`; sector → industry
  grouping + `Unclassified` fallback; `finviz_hex` bucket boundaries +
  `±clip_pct` clamp; missing-data → neutral; `apply_colors`
  non-mutation; `members_asof` look-ahead exclusion + inclusive boundary
  (`Date added == as_of` stays in); `build_layout` sets `approx_size`
  for flagged symbols only.

## Known limitations / Future work
- Membership is point-in-time via the `Date added` filter
  (`members_asof`), so look-ahead names are removed; names that *left*
  the index before today remain absent (survivorship residual, surfaced
  by a coverage label). Full membership via a Wikipedia changes-log
  reconstruction is v2. `sector` / `industry` (GICS) stay as-of-today.
  Shares are **historical** (yfinance `get_shares_full`, ~11y); before
  the series starts the caller carries back the earliest known count
  (nearest-in-time) and those tiles are `approx_size` + noted in the
  coverage label. Depth upgrades: SEC EDGAR XBRL (~2009, CIK in
  `tools/sp500.csv`), then a paid provider (decades) — v2/later. See
  [`docs/SANDBOX_HEATMAP.md`](../../../docs/SANDBOX_HEATMAP.md).
- v1 color basis is 1-Day % only. RS / vs-SPY and the owner's pluggable
  custom-RS metric are v2 — accepted via a different `pct_by_symbol`
  map, no API change.
- Additional Finviz timeframes (1W … YTD) are v2 (need trailing daily
  history per symbol).

## Recent history
- Pure layer implemented (`heatmap.py`) + `tests/unit/backtest/test_heatmap.py`.
  Adds `price_at_or_before` as the one clock-aware helper and optional
  `timeframe` / `universe_id` on `apply_colors`; layout math is pure
  Python (no numpy). Encodes the eleven v1 decisions (see
  `docs/SANDBOX_HEATMAP.md`).
