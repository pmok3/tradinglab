# backtest/performance.py — Spec

## Purpose
Pure-Python aggregates over a [`SessionResult`](session.spec.md) feeding Phase 1d's Performance View. Derived structures cover trades, setup/proximity rollups, replay-day journals (notes, trades, and explicit decisions), and realized P&L. Export helpers write trade and decision CSVs. No Tk imports.

## Computed in Phase 1
- Trade rows: entry / exit ts + price, qty, P&L (dollar + percent), MAE / MFE (dollar + percent), setup tag, conviction, thesis, target.
- Per-setup and per-proximity aggregates: `count`, `wins`, `losses`, `win_rate`, `avg_pnl`, `total_pnl`, `avg_win`, `avg_loss`, `expectancy`.
- **Expectancy formula**: `expectancy = win_rate × avg_win + (1 − win_rate) × avg_loss` (with `avg_loss` signed-negative). NOT the same as `avg_pnl` once break-even trades exist.
- Realized P&L curve sampled at every `result.equity_curve` ts.
- CSV trade-journal export with stable relative paths to mirrored screenshots (sibling `<csv_stem>_screenshots/`).
- TSV clipboard export (header + rows; screenshot columns omitted).
- Standalone logged-decisions CSV with human-readable timestamp, symbol, action, setup tag, confidence, and note.

## Public API
- `@dataclass(frozen=True) class TradeRow` — `post: PostTradeReview`, `pre: Optional[PreTradeEntry]`. Properties: `setup_tag` (lowercase or `""`), `is_win`, `is_loss`, `thesis`, `conviction`, `target`.
- `@dataclass(frozen=True) class TradeStats` — shared win/loss/expectancy reduction output: `count`, `wins`, `losses`, `win_rate`, `loss_rate`, `avg_pnl`, `total_pnl`, `avg_win`, `avg_loss`, `expectancy`. Carries `loss_rate` (which `SetupAggregate` / `ProximityAggregate` omit) because `expectancy` derives from it.
- `@dataclass(frozen=True) class SetupAggregate` — `setup_tag`, `count`, `wins`, `losses`, `win_rate`, `avg_pnl`, `total_pnl`, `avg_win`, `avg_loss`, `expectancy`.
- `@dataclass(frozen=True) class ProximityAggregate` — `proximity_tag`, `count`, `wins`, `losses`, `win_rate`, `avg_pnl`, `total_pnl`, `avg_win`, `avg_loss`, `expectancy`.
- `build_trade_rows(result) -> List[TradeRow]` — join post-trades with pre-trades on `ref_pre_trade_id == order_id`. Preserves `result.post_trades` order (close-time order).
- `summarize_trade_rows(rows: Sequence[TradeRow]) -> TradeStats` — single source of truth for the win/loss/expectancy reduction. `build_setup_aggregates` and `build_proximity_aggregates` both delegate to it (they previously inlined byte-identical 12-line blocks), as does `strategy_tester/report.py` (previously a fourth transcription of the expectancy formula).
- `build_setup_aggregates(rows) -> List[SetupAggregate]` — group by `setup_tag`, sort `(-count, setup_tag)`.
- `build_proximity_aggregates(rows) -> List[ProximityAggregate]` — group by non-empty `earnings_proximity_tag` / `dividend_proximity_tag`; rows with neither tag go under `""`. A row with both tags contributes to both groups. Sorts `(-count, proximity_tag)`.
- `@dataclass(frozen=True) class DayGroup` — `date_iso` (UTC `YYYY-MM-DD`), `ordinal` (1-based chronological rank), `note`, `rows: Tuple[TradeRow, ...]` (entry-ordered), `decisions: Tuple[DecisionRecord, ...]` (timestamp-ordered), `total_pnl`, `wins`, `losses`.
- `build_day_groups(result) -> List[DayGroup]` — group closed trades and explicit decisions by UTC session date, attach `result.day_notes[date]`, include note-only, trade-only, and decision-only days, sort chronologically, assign `ordinal`.
- `realized_pnl_curve(result) -> List[Tuple[int, float]]` — for each `(ts, _)` in `result.equity_curve`, emit `(ts, starting_cash + Σ p.pnl for p in post_trades where p.exit_ts <= ts)`. Anchored at `result.spec.starting_cash` (NOT `equity_curve[0]` — engine processes fills before MTM, so the first equity entry can already include fill effects).
- `screenshot_filenames(row, *, index) -> Tuple[Optional[str], Optional[str]]` — derives pre/post filenames captured by [`SandboxController._capture_screenshot`](replay.spec.md). Pre is `f"{row.pre.order_id}_pre.png"` or `None`. Post uses `ref_id = row.post.ref_pre_trade_id or f"close-{index:04d}"`. **`index` MUST match the row's position in `result.post_trades`.**
- `CSV_COLUMNS: Tuple[str, ...]` — canonical order: `order_id, entry_iso, exit_iso, holding_seconds, symbol, side, qty, entry_price, exit_price, pnl, pnl_pct, mae, mae_pct, mfe, mfe_pct, setup_tag, conviction, target, thesis, user_review, pre_screenshot, post_screenshot`. The ``entry_iso`` / ``exit_iso`` columns hold prose-style Eastern-Time strings (``"February 27th, 09:50 ET"``) — the legacy integer-second ``entry_ts`` / ``exit_ts`` columns were dropped per user request ("none of this 1e9 business").
- `trade_row_to_csv_record(row, *, index, pre_rel="", post_rel="") -> Dict[str, str]` — single-row stringified record.
- `trade_rows_to_tsv(rows) -> str` — header + body, tab-separated. Screenshot columns omitted (Excel-paste use case).
- `write_trade_rows_csv(rows, *, csv_path, screenshot_dir=None) -> Path` — UTF-8 CSV via `csv.DictWriter(newline="")`. When `screenshot_dir` is provided, copies every existing pre/post PNG into sibling `<csv_stem>_screenshots/`; CSV references via stable `<stem>_screenshots/<fname>` relative paths.
- `DECISION_CSV_COLUMNS`, `decision_to_csv_record(decision)`, `write_decisions_csv(decisions, *, csv_path) -> Path` — standalone explicit-decision audit export; notes are flattened to one line and timestamps are full ISO-8601 UTC strings rather than raw epoch integers.

## Dependencies
- Internal: [`journal`](journal.spec.md), [`session`](session.spec.md), [`core/timezones`](../core/timezones.spec.md).
- Stdlib: `csv`, `shutil`, `datetime`, `collections.abc` (`Sequence`).

## Design Decisions
- **Expectancy = `win_rate × avg_win + loss_rate × avg_loss`** (`avg_loss` signed-negative). Matches discretionary-trader convention; equivalent to `avg_pnl` only when no break-evens.
- **`summarize_trade_rows` is the one definition of the win/loss/expectancy reduction.** `build_setup_aggregates`, `build_proximity_aggregates`, and `strategy_tester/report.py` all delegate to it instead of each carrying a byte-identical copy of the formula, so a change to the definition (counting break-evens, netting commissions) can't silently skip one call site. Break-even trades (`pnl == 0`) count toward `count` but toward neither `wins` nor `losses` (pre-existing, deliberate).
- **R-multiple intentionally omitted** — MVP doesn't model stops.
- **`build_day_groups` keys by UTC session date** (matching `SandboxController.current_session_date`). Days are the union of trade-entry dates, decision timestamps, and `day_notes` keys, so note-only and decision-only days remain reviewable. Trades and decisions are independently ordered; the GUI interleaves them by timestamp.
- **Unattributed rows bucketed under `setup_tag = ""`** when `post.ref_pre_trade_id` missing or no matching pre-trade. UI renders as `"(unattributed)"`.
- **Stable sort by `(-count, tag)`** — most-frequent first; alphabetical ties. Applies to both setup and proximity aggregates.
- **Realized curve anchored at `spec.starting_cash`, not `equity_curve[0]`.** Engine ticks fills *before* MTM (`engine.tick()` calls `_process_fills` then `_mark_to_market`), so `equity_curve[0]` already reflects fill effects.
- **Realized series is gross of commissions / partials by design.** Plots `starting_cash + Σ post.pnl`, stepping at `exit_ts`. MTM curve carries the full accounting; the gap is "open MTM + commissions + partial-exit cashflows."
- **CSV bundles screenshots into `<csv_stem>_screenshots/` next to the CSV (mirror, not link).** Avoids `os.path.relpath` cross-drive failures on Windows and `..\..\..` brittleness when moved/emailed; matches `save_session`'s convention.

## Invariants
- `len(build_trade_rows(r)) == len(r.post_trades)` (1:1, in order).
- A `TradeRow` whose `pre is None` has `setup_tag == ""`, `thesis == ""`, `conviction == 0`, `target is None`.
- For each `SetupAggregate`, `wins + losses + (count - wins - losses) == count` (residual = break-evens).
- `TradeStats.win_rate + TradeStats.loss_rate <= 1.0`, equal to `1.0` iff the bucket has no break-even trades.
- `build_setup_aggregates([])` and `build_proximity_aggregates([])` return `[]`.
- `build_day_groups` returns one `DayGroup` per distinct day (union of trade-entry UTC dates, decision UTC dates, and `day_notes` keys), chronologically ordered with `ordinal` 1..N; a result with none of those records returns `[]`.
- `write_decisions_csv` writes only explicit `SessionResult.decisions`; it never synthesizes rows for unlogged bars.
- `realized_pnl_curve(result)` has the same length / timestamps as `result.equity_curve`.
- `realized_pnl_curve(result)[0][1] == result.spec.starting_cash` when no `post.exit_ts <= equity_curve[0][0]`.
- `realized_pnl_curve(result)[-1][1] == result.spec.starting_cash + sum(p.pnl for p in result.post_trades)` when the last equity timestamp is at-or-after every close.
- `write_trade_rows_csv` writes exactly `len(rows)` data rows under `CSV_COLUMNS`. Sibling `<stem>_screenshots/` created iff at least one referenced PNG exists in `screenshot_dir`.
